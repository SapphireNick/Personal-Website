# Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website! Help and suggestions are welcomed!

## How to run

First you need to get [grape](https://github.com/SapphireNick/grape) which currently serves as a small
backend for this website. Run this in the background before proceeding.

Afterwards, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
